Although the amount of road accidents and casualties amongst all road types have gradually started decreasing, there are some factors still contributes the major part to road accident and casualties in Britain. Car riders accounted for more than 90% of road casualties of all severities in Britain in last 4 years. there has been fall in slight injury on 30 mph roads but still it account for most of the casualty among different speed limit range. The amount of casualties for all severities could be reduced by improvements in road design, traffic management and enforcement of stricter laws. This will require the public sector to be committed and adequately financed and be capable of taking comprehensive action.The literature review will consist of factors that contribute to these accidents like lighting, weather, road surface conditions, road type, Driving speed, drink driving rates, etc. My aim is to analyze these Factors, by mapping the data to explore the pattern of accident conditions across the country and to see if there is any relationship that I can find between environmental conditions and the rate of accidents.
